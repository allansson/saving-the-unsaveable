## Life of a system

+++

### 1994

<!-- .slide: data-background-transition="none" -->
![System architecture](assets/system_arch_001.png)

Note:
Just a thin client directly over a database.

+++
### 1999

_Web portal in ASP and VB6_

![System architecture](assets/system_arch_001.png)

Note:
Web is not useful enough to do everything the desktop client does.

### 2000

_Integrate with 3rd parties by using file exports_

<!-- .slide: data-background-transition="none" -->
![System architecture](assets/system_arch_001.png)

Note:
Mixture of VBScript and scheduled tasks

+++
### 2002

_Rewrite web portal using ASP.NET and WebForms_

<!-- .slide: data-background-transition="none" -->
![System architecture](assets/system_arch_001.png)

Note:
Still using VB though
Web is pretending it can be useful enough

### 2004

_We need more reports!_

<!-- .slide: data-background-transition="none" -->
![System architecture](assets/system_arch_001.png)

Note:
SSRS and SSAS are added along with a Data Warehouse-database (a.k.a. the cube)
Somewhere, somehow a job is running each night to build "the cube"

+++
### 2005

_File integrations are upgraded to SSIS_

<!-- .slide: data-background-transition="none" -->
